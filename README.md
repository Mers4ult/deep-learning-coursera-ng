# Deep Learning Specialization Course Notes
forked from lijqhs/deeplearning-notes

[Notes in web format](https://www.aaronnotes.com/deeplearning-notes/)

This is the notes of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera.

Introduction from the specialization page:

>In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.

# DeepLearning.ai Courses Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries on [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) specialization courses. I've enjoyed every little bit of the course hope you enjoy my notes too.

[DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)  contains five courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The five courses titles are:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.
5. Sequence Models.

This is by far the best course series on deep learning that I've taken. Enjoy!

A good Facebook group that discusses the courses are here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepLearningAISpecialization/.

Group description:

> This group is for current, past or future students of Prof Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai class in Coursera. The purpose is for students to get to know each other, ask questions, and share insights. However, remember the Coursera Honor Code - please do not post any solution in the forum! 



## Next steps

Taking [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) courses series as it focuses more on the practical works.
